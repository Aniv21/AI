An AI Project
AI research has focused on improving the decision-making capabilities of computers, i.e., the ability to select high-quality actions in pursuit of a given objective. When the objective is aligned with the values of the human race, this can lead to tremendous benefits. When the objective is misaligned, improving the AI systemâ€™s decision-making may lead to worse outcomes for the human race. 
General game playing has quickly evolved into an established research area. More recently it is also gaining popularity as a useful addition to AI curricula at universities around the world.
In this project we create a game playing agent that can beat opponents in the game of isolation by training it to take good decisions. This is achieved using Minimax, Alpha-Beta Search and Iterative Deepening.s
